# djano-import-export-celery
instead of installing from pypy django-import-export-celery
copied django-app from https://github.com/auto-mat/django-import-export-celery 

added the following requirements to requirements.txt:
django-author
html2text

Adjusted the admin to only IMPORT - removed the export code
